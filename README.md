# C Programming for Everybody (CC4E)

This is code I wrote while taking [Dr. Chuck's CC4E
course](https://www.cc4e.com), which teaches C from a historical perspective
using K&R as the main source material. Some of the code is copied (mostly
manually by typing the code myself) from the book or Dr. Chuck's presentation.

**Note:** some exercise solutions in this repo might be different from the
starter code in the autograder in the course website. This is because I write
the solutions from scratch and then check the autograder.

**Warning:** if you are a fellow CC4E student and found this repo while
searching for a solution, allow me to echo Dr. Chuck's warnings that you
shouldn't be getting online solutions to solve the assignments.
